# Welcome to the Medley Interlisp Wiki!
## Communication

There are lots of ways you can find out more and communicate with others:

* Web site [https://interlisp.org](https://interlisp.org)
* README files in the Interlisp repositories
* The Medley repository [Issues](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues)and [Discussions](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/discussions)
* Two mailing lists with archives: [interlisp](https://groups.google.com/g/interlisp) and [lispcore](https://groups.google.com/g/lispcore).
* Some files that were being managed via Google docs (The History Timeline and Objectives)

The web site is probably the hardest to modify, but it's the entry point for many. https://github.com/interlisp/interlisp.github.io make changes.
README files should explain what is there in terms of files and so forth. 
The repo Issues and Discussions are more threaded (and more accessible) than email to mailing lists.

So what goes here in the Wiki? (a) The History and Timeline (b) The Objectives (want to ask the community to add their background and interest, a virtual guest book) (c) Getting it up and running walkthroughs.
